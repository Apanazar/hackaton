Every day we note a reduced number of cases “Health Minister Adam Niedzielski added:- ‘Today we abolish most of the restrictions and leave only those that are necessary – Covid 19 will be treated like the flu’.The following restrictions will be removed – effective from 1st March.All occupancy limits will be removed– including in shops, restaurants, places of culture, transport, as well as during meetings and events. Discos, clubs and other places available for dancing will reopen.“We are also restoring normal work in offices. Remote work was obligatory in official offices, and recommended in companies and enterprises, today we abolish this recommendation, today offices are returning to normal functioning”.The following restrictions will continue to apply.Covering the nose and mouth with a mask in confined spaces will still be required. You must continue to wear a mask in places such as the bus, shop or cinema. Isolation in the event of COVID-19 infection – If you fall ill, you will have to isolate.  Isolation applies to a COVID-19 infected person with a positive test result.    The isolation period is 7 days if you are not symptomatic for COVID-19. Your GP may decide to extend it if your health condition requires it.  You can read more about this on the gov.pl website.Arrival quarantine (for persons without a valid UCC).  Quarantine also applies when you return from abroad (only if you do not have a valid UCC).  Quarantine lasts 7 days.  You can read more about this on the gov.pl websiteQuarantine for a cohabitant of a COVID-19 infected person. Quarantine is the isolation of a healthy person because of the risk of infection. This applies if you live with someone who is infected with coronavirus.If you live with someone who is sick, your quarantine will last as long as your isolating home partner.For 30 days after the end of the disease, people who have ended isolation or hospitalisation will not be quarantined because they live with the person in isolation.It is important to remember that:“Unfortunately, the chapter of the pandemic is not closed yet, We will observe what is happening in other countries” – the Prime Minister added. icon-link Full details on the removal of restrictions can be found on the Ministry of health website. icon-external More Coronavirus information is available on the Gov.pl website.\nA Scot in Kraków.

As calculated by the authors of the report, the city’s traffic congestion in 2021 was 42%, which placed it in 20th position in the global ranking (12th among European cities, second among cities with less than 800,000 inhabitants).Łódź ranked higher than Kraków – in 13th place in the world ranking. Wrocław was 22nd, Warsaw 30th and Poznań 33rd.Increased car ownership leads inevitably to increased and ore frequent congestion.  Whilst it is not easy to give the exact number of cars that travel on Krakow’s roads every day. Data provided by the Krakow City Hall show that in 2019 over 525,000 people were registered in the city. There were 685 cars for every 1000 residents.  In reality, there are many more cars on the city roads, it’s not uncommon for new Kraków residents vehicles to still be registered in the places they moved from. There are also cars that commute to the city every day, as well as tourists and transit traffic.  (source Wyborcza.pl – Kraków)You can read the full TomTom Traffic Congestion Ranking here.\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-22995\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/traffic-1.jpeg?resize=700%2C467\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/traffic-1.jpeg?resize=700%2C467\u0026amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i1.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/traffic-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C200\u0026amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/traffic-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C513\u0026amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/traffic-1.jpeg?resize=450%2C300\u0026amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i1.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/traffic-1.jpeg?resize=1198%2C800\u0026amp;ssl=1 1198w, https://i1.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/traffic-1.jpeg?resize=600%2C401\u0026amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/traffic-1.jpeg?w=1240\u0026amp;ssl=1 1240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003eHint that Bunkier Cafe may return – perhaps?\nMany hearts were broken, when the legendary Bunkier Cafe, a favourite of locals and tourists alike,  was closed in October 2020 to make way for major renovation work at  Bunkier Sztuki Contemporary Art Gallery.  The cafe was dismantled and work has been ongoing on the site. We wrote about the closure back in October 2020.This week however, a spokesperson for the Art Gallery provided an update on the renovation work and announced that :-“”The gallery has made efforts to additionally place the cafe in its current location, in front of the building.”The spokesperson added that the new cafe will be reopened, according to the plans – inside the building, on level minus one. In addition, the gallery has made efforts to additionally place the cafe in its current location, in front of the building,“We would not like to reveal too much about our immediate surroundings at this stage. All this is at the stage of preliminary findings”This suggests that there is now a chance that the popular Bunkier Cafe, which disappeared from Planty at the beginning of the renovation after nearly two decades of operation, will return to its place. The bistro may come back, despite the earlier project assuming the location of the café in the basement of the Gallery.     (source: Gazeta Krakowska) \u003cimg src=\"https://i2.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Bunkier-Cafe.jpg?resize=700%2C525\u0026amp;ssl=1\" /\u003eDon’t park like an idiot. If you do, don’t lie about only having a foreign drivers licence!\nAn inconsiderate motorist abandoned his car blocking a bus route serving Rydygier Hospital which has a notorious and recurring problem with badly parked cars blocking the bus lane.  The Straż Miejska were called, towed the vehicle, and issued a 500zł fine.This would have been bad enough for the driver, however when asked to provide his documents the irresponsible driver showed the officers an American drivers licence, claiming not to have any Polish licence.Unfortunately for him, the officer made further checks and ascertained that he had indeed had a Polish, drivers licence, but this has been revoked.  Police are now investigating the matter of driving without proper authorisation.   (source: Gazeta Krakowska)New Sports Complex to be built at Clepardia, Prądnik Biały\nThe existing Clepardia sports complex will be transformed into a multifunctional sports facility.

The bikes are to be delivered within three months of the contract signing, hopefully in time for Summer?   Initially, there will be 250 regular bikes and 250 electric bikes.Marcin Wójcik from the Public Transport Authority (ZTP – Zarząd Transportu Publicznego w Krakowie) announced  that the planned system will be based on a monthly subscription – “We want to offer really affordable subscriptions,” added Wójcik, but didn’t provide a specific price.Long term city bike rental schemes operate already in other cities across Europe and are said to offer some benefit sto users, as they include a promised 48 hour repair or replacement as part of the subscription. Bicycles rented on a longer term, tend to be maintained and looked after better by the user, lessening the chance of renting a damaged or broken bike.Kraków was home to the first ever city bike rental scheme in Poland, which started in 2008. Many will recall the Wawelo city bikes which were a common sight across Kraków, but stopped operating at the end of 2019.  Some can still be seen riding through the city, as the operator offered the ex-rental bikes for sale, many of which are still in use.The city is also continuing the development of the Park-e-Bike Kraków scheme, currently only available at the Czerwone Maki P\u0026R car park. There are plans to purchase an additional 100 bikes and make them available on the same terms in other P\u0026R car parks.A Scot in Kraków.
