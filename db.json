It is divided into 16 regions known as voivodeships.  It is the fifth largest EU country, located in Central Europe (not East European – many Poles don’t like that label).  Poland is currently in the third Republic, having failed to exist, occupied, partitioned, or consumed into other commonwealths in its history.\n\n\n\nThe country is at the strategic and trading crossroads of Europe bringing riches from traders and many invasions, from the Swedes, Tartars, and many others.With increased investment creating  jobs in international corporations and ‘reverse migration’ the country is slowly becoming more multicultural, however Poland was reported as a very monocultural 98% Polish in the 2011 census. (this figure will have changed a fair bit, over the past decade, with a new report awaited following a national census last year)Read more here or for anyone wanting to dig deeper, get a copy of Norman Davies books ‘God’s Playground’ or ‘Heart of Poland’\n\nKRAKOW  (Cracow) – krakuf    listen     Former Royal Capital, a truly magical City.\n\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-26446 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-krkaow-drone.jpg?resize=700%2C394\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-krkaow-drone.jpg?resize=700%2C394\u0026amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i0.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-krkaow-drone.jpg?resize=300%2C169\u0026amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-krkaow-drone.jpg?resize=768%2C433\u0026amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-krkaow-drone.jpg?resize=450%2C254\u0026amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-krkaow-drone.jpg?resize=1420%2C800\u0026amp;ssl=1 1420w, https://i0.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-krkaow-drone.jpg?resize=600%2C338\u0026amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-krkaow-drone.jpg?resize=480%2C270\u0026amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-krkaow-drone.jpg?resize=133%2C75\u0026amp;ssl=1 133w, https://i0.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-krkaow-drone.jpg?w=1475\u0026amp;ssl=1 1475w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003eLocated in Southern Poland in the Małopolska (Lesser Poland) region, around 1.5 hours from the Czech, Slovak and Ukrainian borders.\n\nKraków is a UNESCO world heritage city of culture and is widely considered to be the intellectual and cultural heart of Poland.\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-27039\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Krakow-Tartan-Presentation.png?resize=700%2C357\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"357\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Krakow-Tartan-Presentation.png?resize=700%2C357\u0026amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i2.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Krakow-Tartan-Presentation.png?resize=300%2C153\u0026amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Krakow-Tartan-Presentation.png?resize=768%2C392\u0026amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Krakow-Tartan-Presentation.png?resize=450%2C230\u0026amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i2.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Krakow-Tartan-Presentation.png?resize=600%2C306\u0026amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Krakow-Tartan-Presentation.png?w=1400\u0026amp;ssl=1 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003ePRESIDENT of KRAKÓW WELCOMES THE TARTAN ARMY TO KRAKÓW.I contacted Jacek Majchrowski, the President of Kraków, who I know is a keen supporter of the Kraków – Edinburgh partnership and Scottish Polish connections, inviting him to share a welcome message for the Tartan Army visiting Kraków.He was kind enough to share this message:-Ladies and Gentlemen,The upcoming Ukraine-Scotland match, which will be held in Krakow, is an excellent opportunity to emphasise the friendly Polish-Ukrainian-Scottish relations. Polish Krakow, Ukrainian Kyiv and Scottish Edinburgh are interconnected by official cooperation agreements and a rich portfolio of projects implemented over the years. The flagship project that connects our countries and cities on the promotional level – referring to the culture and heritage of Scotland – is “Scottish Tartan”. Krakow was the first Polish city to receive its own tartan – designed and donated to us in 2017 by Edinburgh. Ukraine also received its own tartan – in characteristic yellow and blue colours! Designed by ‘Great Scot’ and called “Ukraine Forever”, the checkered pattern is an expression of solidarity with the fighting Ukraine, and the proceeds from the sale of gadgets with this image are to fund the accounts of charity organisations helping Ukrainian refugees.The clash with the Ukrainian national team – as the previous Scotland-Ukraine matches played as part of the League of Nations in Glasgow, have already shown – will not be an easy task for the Scottish team, but it will be a task worthy of a brave heart. Because Ukraine is a worthy opponent, which is shown not only by the history of sport, but also by universal history – including the most recent one, unfolding before our eyes. The war between Ukraine and Russia for independence and the right to self-determination is, of course, an inspiration also for Ukrainian footballers. The history of Ukrainian football – although dating back only to the end of the nineteenth century, and therefore not as old as in the case of Scotland – is full of surprising twists and names of outstanding sportsmen such as Walery Łobanowski and Andrij Szewczenko.I am sure that the match played on 27th September,  with friends, will be a great spectacle. I invite you to Cracow!Jacek Majchrowski, President of the City of KrakowThere are many historic and current connections with Scotland – the city is twinned with Edinburgh, and has its own Kraków Tartan, we even had a tartan tram for a year, (ahem, thanks to my proposal, in a city contest seeking suggestions on how best to promote the tartan)\n\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-26445\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-tram.png?resize=700%2C153\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"153\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-tram.png?resize=700%2C153\u0026amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i2.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-tram.png?resize=300%2C66\u0026amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-tram.png?resize=768%2C168\u0026amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-tram.png?resize=450%2C98\u0026amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i2.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-tram.png?resize=600%2C131\u0026amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-tram.png?w=960\u0026amp;ssl=1 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003e\n\nin 1585 King Stefan Batory, the Polish King,  commanded:\n\n‘The Scots who always follow our court and who are at liberty in all places, …in Kraków likewise.  Now We command you to put nothing in their way in this business,…that they should enjoy the same privileges in Kraków as elsewhere.

The architecture and history reflect the many influences of the various occupiers of the city over the centuries.  Wawel castle and Cathedral are sacred to Poles.  The Cathedral is the UK equivalent of Westminster abbey where kings, queens and the great of Poland are buried.The Poles are hugely proud of the ‘Polish Pope, Karol Woytla, JPII, born in nearby Wadowice, but studied, lived, and worked in Kraków.

Alternatively, anywhere in Kazimierz (Jewish District) or in the area between Kazimierz and the Old Town.\n\n\n\nThe Cracovia stadium is just outside the old town/Planty/Ring Road to the West.  It’s all very walkable. Train Station is just outside the Planty to the Northeast.  Most tourists and I’m sure the TA will gravitate to the Main Square, Rynek Główny.\n\nAirBnB and Booking.com both operate and there are many hotel options from budget to deluxe., and several decent hostels.\n\nHigh accommodation demand, along with growing international investment/employees, students, tourists and of course the huge influx of people fleeing war in Ukraine, are putting pressure on the long-term rental market, so some short-term holiday lets are moving to long term rental which may adversely affect availability and prices.   Kraków is also home to many universities with a student population of over 200,000.  Students will be starting to return to the city at the end of September for the start of the Winter semester in October.\n\nUKRAINIANS in KRAKÓWKraków was already home to around 60,000 registered Ukrainians prior to the war, with many more unregistered.\n\n\n\nFollowing 24th February, around 180,000 plus refugees came to Kraków, some have moved on, but it is estimated that 150,000-200,000 Ukrainians are living in the city, most likely many more, with refugees continuing to arrive daily.\n\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-26442\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-UA.png?resize=700%2C283\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"283\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-UA.png?resize=700%2C283\u0026amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i0.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-UA.png?resize=300%2C121\u0026amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-UA.png?resize=768%2C311\u0026amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-UA.png?resize=450%2C182\u0026amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-UA.png?resize=600%2C243\u0026amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-UA.png?w=988\u0026amp;ssl=1 988w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003eKraków is also twinned with Lviv and have, like the tartan army sunshine appeal, been supporting the city of Lviv.  There are many refugee support groups and centres still operating in the city.\n\nI wrote a comprehensive article detailing the situation regarding Ukrainians in Kraków here.The Tartan Army Sunshine Appeal – Donations for Bebiko AppealSince the war in Ukraine started, we have had many people approaching us asking how they can do their own little bit to help the children that we will be donating to in Ukraine.

I attended the Poland v Scotland game in Warsaw (2014) where Polish fans and TA partied together, applauding each other during and following the game.\n\nVideos from Warsaw:    Polish fans applauding the Scottish AnthemScottish and Polish Fans pre-match funPoles applauding the TA leaving the stadium\n\nYou can read more about Football in Kraków, in this ‘Krakow in your Pocket’ article.\n\nUkrainian FA Website\n\nFOOTBALL POLICINGUPDATE – 20.9.22 – Police UpdateI have spoken to the Polish Police Football Unit to ask regarding possible tolerance to drinking in public and their view on any impromptu march to the stadium.They replied:-Drinking in Public?:“I haven’t heard that drinking alcohol in public has ever been suspended in Poland – the police were more tolerant at EURO 2012, but that’s because that was the policy from the start. There are gardens open all the time in Krakow with the possibility to drink beer, or places open for that. Unfortunately, I can’t guarantee that the Police won’t issue fines.”Alcohol at the Stadium?“I have to ask this because, at the beginning, all matches of teams from Ukraine were supposed to be high-risk events, and during such matches you can’t buy alcohol, only then do they sell non-alcoholic beer”March to the Stadium?:“If Scottish fans wish to march from the main square to the stadium police will secure the march. In my experience the Police prefer to have everything under control and everyone in one place, it is easier for them to secure the area and observe the behaviour and watch out for threats.I spent the day with Kraków Police Football Intelligence Unit, covering the policing of the infamous Kraków Derby,  in the run up to Euro 2012, and was privileged to have unprecedented access thanks to a shared profession in a previous life.\n\n\n\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-26436\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-police.png?resize=700%2C171\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"171\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-police.png?resize=700%2C171\u0026amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i1.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-police.png?resize=300%2C73\u0026amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-police.png?resize=768%2C188\u0026amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-police.png?resize=450%2C110\u0026amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i1.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-police.png?resize=600%2C147\u0026amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-police.png?w=956\u0026amp;ssl=1 956w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003eThe Policing is robust, but fair and professional.  Look out for shotguns with rubber rounds, water cannon, LRAD acoustic loudspeaker, dogs, flamethrower type CS spray with orange die dispensers, etc.\n\nPrivate security firms operate within the stadium, dressed in protective gear similar to the Policja.\n\nYou can read my account of the day here – Policing the Kraków Derby – The ‘holy War’ and see an album of photographs here –  Policing the Kraków Derby – Online Album.  Ross Kemp did a documentary on the Kraków derby, which is on youtube here.\n\nLANGUAGEPolish is the official language.

(Scottish – shotlandsʹkyy, Scot – shotlandetsʹ)\n\n\n\n\n\nCURRENCY, CASH, ATM’s etcThe currency is the Polish Złoty (abr. zł  code PLN) and Grosz.  Currently 5.6 zł to £1 (click for latest)Polish exchanges are known as Kantor’s.  Be warned, many are connected with organised crime, and often will do the usual trick/scam of highlighting prominently in the window the higher sell rate rather than the lower buy rate to mislead customers.Card and electronic payments are widely accepted.  Some ATM’s mostly, ones in shops etc, operated by ‘Euronet’ may charge a small fee.  Try to use ATM’s at banks.\n\nTraders are legally compelled to issue a receipt (paragon), if you need to reclaim VAT ask for a Faktura.   You will often be asked if you want a copy of the receipt.\n\nLoose change – Many Polish traders seem incapable of managing point of sale floats and will almost always ask for small change (drobne) if you tender a note.   It’s enough to pat your pockets, shrug your shoulders and shake your head apologetically, or say ‘nie mam drobnych’. It’s not the first time I’ve had to leave a purchase behind after a ‘no small change’ standoff 😉\n\nPHONES/WIFI etcLike any major city, wifi is widely available.  Play, Orange, Tmobile and Plus are the main mobile providers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re staying longer, or plan to use a lot of data, You can buy starter packs for call, texts or data at many shops (Zabka etc) , supermarkets, petrol stations kiosks etc.  They can be very cheap, 5zl, 15zl. etc depending on the data included.  You must register the sim using your passport, though this is easy to do online or in a main provider shop Galleria Kazimierz, Galeria Krakowska etc)\n\nHere’s an example of the Play SIM prepaid starter offer. And from Plus\n\nSAFETY, SCAMS  \u0026 EMERGENCIES \n\n Crossing the road other than at a crossing or when the red man is showing is an offence, the police regularly conduct checks and will issue an on the spot fine, to tourists \u0026 locals alike \n\n Be very careful when crossing at pedestrian crossings – drivers may not always stop, until last year drivers had priority at crossings some still follow this old rule !!! \n\n Watch out for bicycles, scooters, electric carts/segways etc which can approach silently at speed. \n\n If using a tram, always validate (stamp) your tram ticket immediately – plain clothes ticket inspectors operate, they can be unpleasant and don’t care if you are a tourist. \n\n Drinking in public is illegal, and is strictly enforced \n\n Kraków is a very safe city, crime wise, but usual sensible precautions should be taken.  There really are no places to avoid or ‘no go’ areas, though ul Szewska is home to a cluster of clubs and can be quite ‘lively’ in the evenings. \n\n Strip clubs, friendly girl promoters \u0026 club bouncers – I used to publish a news magazine here, and by far the biggest news story of all time, was an article on guys getting ripped off, often for hundreds or thousands of zł, in strip clubs.  Don’t do it.  It is widely publicised, and the police do little to help.  The bouncers in these places, and some dance clubs can also be more ready to go ‘hands on’ here and can be aggressive.   Beware of being approached by one or two pretty girls offering to go for a drink, they are in the employ of these clubs, and will rip you off. \n\n Public decency offending religion, polish flag etc.  What can be seen as drunken pranks, and fun in some countries, is frowned upon in more ‘conservative’ or religious countries like Poland.  Loud drunken, indecent behaviour will be tolerated less here, just ask some stag guys who literally paid the price.  I know the TA party hard and behave, respecting locals etc, but just a wee heads up! \n\nLaw enforcement:- Polish Police – Policja, Straż Miejska (city guard),  Straż Graniczna (border guard), Służba Celna (customs).  The city guard are responsible for minor offences, parking, illegal traders/buskers, drunks etc.There is a police office on the main square and one in Szeroka, one of the main streets in Kazimierz. Beware of money exchange offices (Kantors) who prominently display the higher sell rate, rather than the lower buy rate,  to trick you. Some ATM’s (Euronet) charge a small fee.Avoid taking a taxi from the street,  especially the private hire type without roof signs and branding etc. They are more expensive.  See the getting around section.\n\nYou must carry your id/passport at all times.\n\nGETTING HELPIn the case of an emergency, mobile phone users should dial 112 to be forwarded to the police, fire department or ambulance.\n\n\n\nFrom a landline or public phone dial the following:\n\nAmbulance:   999Fire:                  998Police:              997\n\n\n\n\n\nUK Embassy in WarsawIf you’re in Poland and you need urgent help (for example, you’ve been attacked, arrested or someone has died), call +48 22 311 00 00 / +44 1908 51 6666.Emergency travel document – You can apply for an emergency travel document if you’re abroad and your passport has been lost or stolen, damaged or expired, and you can’t get a new or replacement passport in time to travel..\n\n\n\nApply online for an emergency travel document – If the person needing the emergency travel document is under 16, a parent or guardian should apply on their behalf.\n\nGETTING THERE \n\nFirst things first, Getting from the airport into townThe Airport is known as – John Paul II Kraków-Balice Airport, approximately 11km West of the city centre – 20-30 mins travel time by car.\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-26434 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-airport.png?resize=700%2C287\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"287\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-airport.png?resize=700%2C287\u0026amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i1.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-airport.png?resize=300%2C123\u0026amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-airport.png?resize=768%2C315\u0026amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-airport.png?resize=450%2C185\u0026amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i1.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-airport.png?resize=600%2C246\u0026amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/krakowexpats.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TA-Kraków-airport.png?w=1475\u0026amp;ssl=1 1475w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003e\n\nI’ve added some info below for those flying to Katowice or Warsaw.\n\nKrakow Airport WebsiteDue to the increased traffic, passengers traveling with both hand luggage and checked baggage are asked to come to Kraków Airport earlier. Please arrive at the airport at least 2 hours before the scheduled departure time.\n\nTrain from Airport – 14zl (approx. 16 mins from airport to main railway station)Timetable\n\nWhere to buy a ticket:\n\n\n\nBus from Airport to City Centre approx. 45 minsThe cheapest option but very slow.  Take the train or Uber/BoltTicket costs about 8-10zl\n\nCar/taxi/ private transfer etc – Journey time 20-30mins\n\nTaxi from airport to city centre, one company has exclusive ‘airport taxi’ rights charging 90-100 zl – don’t do it, there are better/cheaper options.\n\nBolt from 31 zlUber approx 60 zlFree Now from30zl\n\nPrivate Transfer approx 65 zl \u003e. May work out to be a good option if travelling in a group.  Often your accommodation or tour operator, if you have tours booked, will offer a special airport transfer option.\n\nArriving to other airports?\n\nKatowice (Pyrzowice Airport) – Matuszek Mini Bus – 55zl, 2hrsWarsaw (Chopin \u0026 Modlin Airports) –Train/Pendolino – 2h 40m, Flixbus, BlaBla car etc 4-5hrs\n\nGETTING AROUND IN KRAKÓW\n\nWalk! – Seriously!, Kraków is a very walkable city.  There is a ‘Royal Route’ from the Barbikan to Wawel Castle, cutting through the Market Square.  Kazimierz and Podgórze are slightly South of the old town, still walkable, but if you want to use some wheels, read on…\n\nBus/TramKraków is well served by trams and buses.  The same ticket works on both.  There are night buses, on limited routes.  You must validate your ticket immediately.  Plain clothes and uniform inspectors do regular controls.  They are known for being merciless to tourists, locals, grannies, schoolkids, they have no mercy.\n\nI use ‘Skycash’ app for tickets and ‘Jakdojade’ for routes/stops etc.\n\nThere are ticket machines at some key stops and on almost all trams \u0026 buses.\n\nPublic Transport Guide (Polish)\n\ne-SCOOTERS, Bolt, Tier, Lime etc.\n\ne-Bikes/e-Mopeds – relatively new and fewer around.\n\nThere are new laws regarding operating scooters when drunk, or carrying passenger, responsible parking etc. (read more here)\n\nIn some areas speed is restricted or scooters banned completely.\n\nUBER, BOLT \u0026 FREE NOW OPERATE IN KRAKÓWKeep in mind that the ‘ride sharing’ services – Uber, Bolt etc,  cannot enter some of the restricted zones, in the old town and Kazimierz/Jewish District. Taxis can enter most zones (excluding main market square).\n\nI reckon it’s still worth walking a little bit, generally to outside of the ‘Planty Park’ which encircles the old town, to use the cheaper ride sharing options.\n\nTAXISAvoid taking a taxi or private hire from the street, especially ones without full taxi door \u0026 roof signs. I use iCar, EKO Taxi.\n\nTOURIST BUGGIES – Known as MelexAs with the Kartors there have been many widely reported cases of the Melex operators being linked to criminal groups.  They do however serve a purpose, and are popular with tourists, especially those with mobility issues.\n\n\n\nSANGS \u0026 CLATTER (Bevy, Scran, Boogie etc)Booze/DrinksKraków has many fab pubs; cellar bars, pavement cafes, beer gardens, river barges, café/bars etc Until about a decade ago, you would be hard pressed to find a decent beer, but there has been a bit of an explosion of craft beers, from International, and some fab Polish breweries.Beer (Piwo) – The standard Polish beers are; Zywiecz, Okocim, Tyskie, and my favourite ‘mainstream’ brewery beers – Perłą, Łomza, Miłosław, Książęce. Beer is sold in large and small measures; dużę piwo (½ litre) and Małe piwo (0.3 litre).The average price of a large beer is around 15 zł, there are still a very few places where you will find beer for 6zl or so, but mainly outside the centre, spit \u0026 sawdust or student places.Bottled beer is very popular, if, like me, you prefer draft, ask for Piwo Lane (pronounced ‘lannae’ not like penny lane.Buying ‘carry oots’ is obviously much cheaper, with beer costing from around 1.70zł to 5+ for craft beer. You will find a Żabka shop on every other street, they’re everywhere, here’s their beer offers. The other main general stores are Lewiatan, and of course supermarkets such as Biedronka, Lidl, Aldi, Carrefour, Auchan etc. Please keep in mind that drinking in public is illegal and strictly enforced!Wine and wine bars are becoming more common, though many pubs still only carry a couple of basic wine choices. Wine is more expensive than beer or vodka.Vodka (wódka) – A few places do flavoured vodkas, popular vodka drinks are Mad Dog (Wściekły pies), one of my favourites, it’s a combo of ice cold vodka, raspberry syrup and tabasco. You have to try it. Another easier to drink option is a ‘tatanka’ which is Żubrówka vodka (the one with the bison grass in the bottle supposedly pissed on by bisons) and apple juice, very easy – too easy! To drink.Coffee (Kawa) and Tea (Herbata) are popular in café bars, often with a large choice of flavoured teas. Hot chocolate (gorąca czekolada) here is the delish, gooey thick, mega-sweet type.Soft Drinks – Sadly no Irn Bru, but usual soft drinks are available, home made  lemonade is popular.Cocktails? – nah didn’t think so, but for those interested; There are a few great cocktail bars such as. Mercy Brown’s, Movida, Mr Black, Sababa. Top Kraków cocktail bars.I will add more information, over the next few days to include short descriptions etc, to the section below.  In the meantime, here’s a list of some of the pubs cafes and eating places to look out for:Some of my favourite bars:- Old TownKlub Pod Jaszczurami  – Tartan Army HQ, prematch gigs, Sunshine  Appeal baseVis a Vis – The oldest original bar on the market square (next to Police Office)Neolita – On Grodzka just off the market square, offering cheap beer and pizza slices.Multi Qlti Tap Bar | Craft BeerAmbasada Śledzia – Herring Embassy – A favourite with locals and tourists alike.Pierwszy Lokal na Stolarskiej po lewej stronie, idąc od Małego Rynku. (The first pub in Stolarska on the left,  going from Mały Rynek – that’s actually the name of the pub and the directions to find it!)Piwnica Pod Baranami – Great cellar bar on the corner of market square, opposite head sculptureKlub Kulturalny – Another super cellar bar, with different rooms RiversideForum – One of the coolest places in Poland, the whole lower floor of a former Communist era hotel have been taken over as bars, food halls, and event spaces.  Great food,, fine selection of craft beers, nice – huge – outside space. A must visit IMHO.Barka – other barges are availableT.E.A. Time Brewpub – Owned by a Yorkshireman, brew their own craft beer.KazimierzSingers – Where all the tables are Singer sewing machines, a truly fabulous pub in the wee sma hoors, great eclectic music mix, dancing on tables.  It’s a club, not a club, gets busy but is great to visit.Alchemia – A Kraków legend, go through to the back rooms and old kitchen via the wardrobe.  Also has a good eatery next door.Eszeweria – A really quaint delightful cafe bar, like stepping back in time, a must see.Klub Piękny PiesSiedem miliardów uśmiechów, a Twój jest moim ulubionym – (Seven billion smiles and yours is my favourite)Indeed it’s hard to argue with many of the choices in this Guide to Kraków BarsThese areas/streets have the best collection of bars:-Stolarska – Old Town – A quiet street, just off the Rynek, home to the American, French and German consulates, hence the bollards at each end fo the road and 24/7 armed Police presence.  But also home to a cluster of decent wee pubs, with a cool vibe.Plac Nowy – Kazimierz – The social heart of the Jewish District.  Plac Nowy is the small square with the rotunda in the centre surrounded by food and market stalls.  Grab a Zapiekanka at one of the windows of the rotunda, or a Kielbasa (gilled sausage) from Kazimierz Grill.  Best bars are the legendary Alchemia (which also has a fine eatery next door),  Nowy Kraftowy , just a wee single door tucked into the corner of the square, but enter to find a large selection of 25 craft beers on tap. also check out Kolory cafe and Zakąski u Ani, a reminder of how Kazimierz bars used to be, simple, but great, vodka shots, and traditional bar food.Plac Wolnica/Mostowa – A line of small pavement cafes and bars with an old school atmosphere.  On the small street leading from Plac Wolnica to the footbridge to Podgórze 9former Ghetto area)ul Szewska – Old Town – The street with several nightclubs, which get’s a bit lively in the evening.  Also in this street you will find Klub Kuluralny, not a nightclub, but definitely worth a visit as one of the best Cellar bars in Kraków. Also Multi Qlti pub on Szewska, has craft beer on tap, Bożego Ciała – Kazimierz – Hevre is a nice cafe bar in an old Jewish prayer house, and there are a number of small bars, often with live music. Not my favourite, indeed definitely not my kinda place, but there are a few cheap tourist boozers, filled with drunk loud tourists and students, look out for Pijalnia.or Bania Luka. Clubs– I don’t use them, I need to ask around for recommendations.  Teatro Cubano seems popular, and there are a cluster of clubs on ul Szewska, one of the streets leading off the main square.  I’ll update this section soon. Prozak 2.0FranticShineSpołem – Styled as a communist era (PRL) club.TED \u0026 TAM’s PRE MATCH PARTIES icon-location Klub Pod Jaszczurami (KPJ)  Rynek Główny 8, KrakówGood Evening Krakow – Night Afore Perty –  Ted Christopher and Tam Coyle icon-day Monday 26th September  icon-time 8pm till 4am  icon-cart Tickets £6 advance (PLN50 on door )Pre Match Party icon-day Tuesday 27th September  icon-time 2pm till 8pm  icon-cart Tickets £6 advance (PLN50 on door) icon-mail TICKETS FOR BOTH EVENTS FROM:-  fwg@tedchristopher.scotPlease send number required.

(Don’t go to the English Football Club mentioned in the sports bar guide – not at all to do with the name, in fact I visited as I loved the possible irony of watching the game in this place, but the manager told me they are only showing premier league games.)\n\n\n\n\n\nFoodKraków has some really amazing restaurants offering International cuisine, traditional Polish food and the usual fast food joints.  There are dozens of kebab shops, often serving tortilla wrap kebabs.  It seems like there is a new Sushi and Indian restaurant opening every other week, however there are few Chinese options and those that exist are best avoided.A uniquely Polish option is a Milk Bar or Bar Mleczny.  think of a student or workers canteen from the 60’s-70’s selling basic food very cheaply.If you’re looking for a good English Breakfast to feed your hangover, try, Moments Resto bar, Milk bar Tomasza (run by Tom Naughton, a very nice Irishman), Scandale Royal, Kolanko.  You won’t get real bangers or bacon like at home, but some of them are close enough to do the job.Here are some popular Polish dishes:-Pierogi – Always wrongly translated to dumplings in English menus – Think of a larger and tastier ravioli, with either a cheese/potato, meat or fruit filling.  Some places are great, some are a bit stodgy. Zapiekanka – Very popular, especially in Plac Nowy, Kazimierz, where most of the windows in the central rotunda building offer Zapikanka in various fillings.  A great filling snack, look’s like, but much larger and better than, a French stick pizza.  Watch out some are a bit processed, try to find somewhere selling fresh toppings, just watch other folks see what they get.  (sometimes listed in English translation as Casserole – nope no idea why either!)Obwarzanek – Unique to Kraków, sold at small carts around the city, for about 1.50-2.50zl, topped in pepper, cheese, or poppyseeds.Kielbasa – Polish sausage on the grill, one of my favourites, often served with a slice of bread and some mustard.  The Kazimierz grill on the corner of Plac Nowy or the world famous ‘Blue Van Kielbasa’ at Hala Targowa are the best.Kaszanka (Polish version of Haggis, not bad at all, but it’s not Haggis!)Oscypek – Small, grilled sheep’s cheese with a dollop of cranberry jam, a bit salty but tasty, slightly rubbery texture.For the sweet tooth:-Paczki – filled doughnuts, traditionally with rose jam, but many options are available in shops on Grodzka and Florianska.  Try to get them hot from the oven, and try the caramel one. Did you Know: On Fat Thursday over 100 million pączki are sold in Poland – (that’s not a typo!)  Read more here.Chimney Cakes – Originally Hungarian.

This year, dragon designs have been inspired by ancient Polish architecture..Ecological ‘quiet’ fireworks\nAs in 2021, this year’s Show will have an ecological formula. The display will use the most modern quiet pyrotechnics – much quieter, but equally visually attractive as traditional pyrotechnics. Quiet fireworks generate a sound with a lower intensity compared to the classic ones, they do not cause a bang, and the noise they emit is insignificant. It will be low and medium height pyrotechnics, not influencing significantly outside the show space, and fully biodegradable.Entry is free, there is a ticketed VIP section, though it appears to be sold out.STREET PARADE ‘Parade of Dragons’\nSunday 5th June  12-3pm\nRoute: Planty (from Gertrudy street) – ul. Grodzka – Main Market Square\nOver 1,000 children from all over the country take part in the Great Dragon Parade.

        "Text": "Here in Kraków and across Poland, we are looking forward to the traditional May holiday weekend, (Majówka), one of the main holiday weekends of the year.  This year, we can look forward to a return of the traditional events, following 2 years of Covid restrictions.Traditional May Holidays\n1st May – Labour Day, (Swieto Pracy) is one of those legacies from communist times, and is celebrated around the world, sometimes known as workers day.  Of course the Poles have put their communist past behind them, but why would they give up the holiday !2nd May – Flag Day, (Dzień Flagi Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej),  A holiday introduced in 2004, it commemorates raising the flag on Siegessäule during the Battle of Berlin.The now familiar red and white colours of the flag were first recognised as the national colours on 3 May 1792, on the first anniversary of the signing of the Constitution of 3 May. They were officially adopted as the colours of the Polish State by the Sejm of the Kingdom of Poland in 1831 during the November Uprising. After Poland regained independence, the appearance of the Polish flag was confirmed by the Legislative Sejm on 1 August 1919.On this day, Poles reflect upon the long history of the red and white national colours and proudly display flags outside their houses. The President of Kraków has made an appeal for residents to fly the flag on their homes and buildings.The red and white will also be flown from official buildings and displayed electronically at the usual places. You will also see other flags; the blue/white city flag, the blue/yellow National flag of Ukraine, in solidarity with our Ukrainian neighbours, and the EU flag, as May 1st marks the 18th Anniversary of Poland’s accession to the EU in 2004.3rd May – Constitution Day, (Święto Konstytucji 3 Maja) is a much more important celebration of Poland’s independence and nationalism. Commemorating the signing of Poland’s and Europe’s first national constitution signed in 1791 in Warsaw.

Senatorskiej, Kasztelańskiej i T. Kościuszki\n\nThe Emaus festival, traditionally takes place on Easter Monday in Salwator, with a parade, and several stalls lining the street, offering a selection of food, toys and treats, arts and crafts. In recent years it was largely  tacky cheap plastic toys and balloons on sale, but in a move to return to more traditional items, the new organisers are making efforts to get rid of the junk.Emaus’ origins date back to the 12th century, and the atmosphere of a colourful fair known today was formed in the 19th century. The event then became a place where sweets and traditional folk toys were sold, including figurines, popular Easter decorations, Easter eggs and characteristic for Krakow Emaus trees carved in wood and decorated with wooden birds and colourful flowers.In recent years, due to the flood of mass-produced toys and the blurring of many typically Krakow traditions, the indulgence has lost much of its authenticity. Instead of handicrafts, it was more common to find imported, plastic products that have nothing to do with the tradition of craftsmanship, nor with folk or Easter creativity. The event was chaotic and the goods were presented at random and inconsistent stands.In the opinion of experts on Emaus, the tradition of artistic craftsmanship is disappearing, commercialisation prevails over cultural functions, and mass-produced items from Asia are replacing what was once the essence of the assortment of the fair.“We want to stop the advancing commercialisation and eliminate controversial products available at the fair.

Government data shows that most Poles prefer summer time.The final decision lies with the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament.   They will have to reach an agreement together for the proposal to take legal effect, and the council has not yet finalised its position.The Council’s final decision will be made on the basis of what’s called Qualified Majority Voting.  Which means that if 55% of countries representing at least 65% of the population of the EU want this to happen, even if the remaining countries vote against – all countries have to go along with it.Previous Polish Debate\nIn October 2017 a bill to abolish time changes unanimously passed its first reading in the Polish Parliament, having had rare cross party support.  Supporters of the legislation argued that the twice-yearly time changes cause health problems,  damages the economy, disrupts businesses and does little to cut energy consumption.“The time changes can lead to imbalances in the body-clock, leading to mood swings, trouble with sleeping, and an increased risk of heart attacks and road accidents”Those against abolishing the time changes argue that being the only EU country not to change time in Spring and Autumn would cause massive problems for Poland;“This will affect every person and every institution. You start with watches, smart phones and computers and end with complex industrial systems that control, for example, pipelines. The list of things that will need to be changed is endless.”Abolishing the time change will also put Poland out of synchronisation with its EU neighbours, most importantly Germany, the country’s biggest trading partner.Poland introduced time changes during the interwar period, then in the years 1946-1949 and 1957-1964;  it has been in force continuously since 1977.   EU Research ‘Why we change the clocks’ (2016)A Scot in Kraków.

        "Text": "Tomorrow, Thursday 24th February, we celebrate ”Fat Thursday’, (Tłusty Czwartek) in Poland.  The tradition is to eat at least one doughnut, known as Pączki, some say you have to eat at least three!Fat Thursday marks the end of Carnival, and beginning of Lent here in Poland.   On Fat Thursday you have to queue at the most popular places, with customers waiting up to 2 hours..   Some bakers operate a more convenient pre-order option.\nIt is reckoned that a mountain of 100 million Pączki, are consumed across Poland on Fat Thursday.For comparison, these were their findings in 2021.Our Doughnut Digest – Pączki news \u0026 events in Kraków Doughnuts to cost more ‘dough’\nBakers are reporting that pączki will cost more this year, with prices rising by 20%,  due to the increase in energy prices and “Polski ład” . Gazeta Wyborcza, undertook a survey of Paczki prices, and discovered: –krk.news.pl offered their choice for the best purveyors of pączki in Kraków.I was dispatched to join one of the snaking queues outside one of the many purveyors of fine Pączki across this city, to restock.  I returned a little later with our 2nd dozen Pączki,.This year, I’ve just come home with 25, and have another 16 ordered for tomorrow. Pączki Fun Facts:\nStatistically, every Pole eats two and a half doughnuts, which adds up to a Pączki mountain of 100 million, consumed across Poland.The big supermarkets, here in Poland, are of course doing their bit, with one offering 22 varieties of doughnut, whilst another is giving 4 free Pączki to each customer.The best Pączki bakers have long queues , and longer order lists, on Fat Thursday.One option to avoid the long queues, or disappointment of empty shelves, is to make your own.Pączki RecipePrep time: 2 hours\nCook time: 20 minutes\nTotal time: 2 hours 30 minutes\nMakes about 20 to 24 pączkiTraditional Polish pączki – yeast doughnuts filled with fruit preserves (rose jam) topped with icing or icing sugar.INGREDIENTS:2 cups whole milk, warmed to 110 degrees F\n4½ teaspoons active dry yeast (2 packages)\n¾ cup + 1 pinch granulated sugar, divided\n5 to 6 cups all-purpose flour, divided\n1 egg\n4 egg yolks\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1¼ teaspoons salt\n4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled\nPeanut oil, canola oil or lard, for frying\nFruit preserves, for filling\nPowdered and granulated sugars, for coating1. Pour warm milk into bowl of a stand mixer. Stir in the yeast and a pinch of granulated sugar. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes, or until it has become bubbly.2. Add 2 cups of flour to the mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until a smooth batter forms. Cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm spot for 30 minutes. The mixture should have risen and be very bubbly.3. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg and egg yolks until pale yellow and frothy, about 3 minutes. Add the sugar, vanilla extract and salt, and whisk until combined and smooth.4. Attach the dough hook to the mixer, add the egg mixture to the dough and mix on medium-low speed until mostly combined. Add the melted butter and mix to combine. Gradually add 3 more cups of flour to the mixture and continue to knead until a very soft dough comes together. (It will not clean the sides of the bowl or form a ball; it will be rather slack and a bit sticky.) If necessary, add up to another 1 cup of flour, a spoonful at a time, until the dough forms.5. Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and set in a warm spot until it has doubled in size.6. Remove the dough from the bowl and turn out onto a floured work surface. With your fingers, push down the dough into an even layer. Sprinkle flour on the dough and roll it out to ½-inch thickness. If the dough doesn’t hold its shape and springs back, cover with a damp towel and let rest for a few minutes and try again.7. Use a 3-inch biscuit cutter to cut out rounds of dough. Transfer the dough rounds to parchment-lined baking sheets. Gather scraps of dough and again roll out and cut until you have used up all of the dough. Cover the baking sheets loosely with plastic wrap and place in a warm, draft-free spot until almost doubled in size, about 30 minutes.A Scot in Kraków.
